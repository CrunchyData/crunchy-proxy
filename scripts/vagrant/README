# Vagrant Test/Development Environment

This directory contains the configurations for creating a virtual development
and test environment for this project.

The Vagrantfile contains the following VM configurations:

* master - the master node
* replica - a replica node

The setup and configuration of these nodes is provided by Ansible. Playbooks
have been defined for each node as well as separate node specific variables.

## Usage

Create and provision the 'master' and 'replica' nodes.

```
$> vagrant up
```

Initialize the replica.

```
$> vagrant ssh replica -- 'bash -s' < ./initialize-replica.sh
```
