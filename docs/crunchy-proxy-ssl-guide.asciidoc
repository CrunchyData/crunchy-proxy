== Overview

Crunchy Proxy supports SSL connections as well as Certificate based
authentication.

The general concept is that since the proxy behaves as both a 'server' and a
'client', it must be configured both from an SSL perspective. Therefore, if
this feature is enabled, then certificates for both scenarios must be available
to the proxy.

When enabled, all pool connections between the proxy and the backends will be a
TLS connection. As well, the temporary connection used to authenticate a
connecting client will also utilize a TLS connection to communicate with the
backend performing the authentications.

If this feature is enable, the proxy will return the appropriate message to the
client that SSL connections are allowed.  Therefore, it is up to the connecting
client to choose whether or not it would like to proceed with making a
connection or not.

== SSL Certificates

For testing purposes certificates have been provided in the projects 'certs'
directory. As well, scripts have been provided to generate new certificates for
both the server and client.  These scripts will create a CA, Intermediate CA's
and the required server and client certificates. The resulting server
certificate is a wildcard certificate so that it can be used across the proxy,
the master and the replicas.

== Configuration

The SSL configuration can be found within the 'credentials' section of the
proxy configuration file. The following table enumerates and describes each
configuration option. *Note*: '_enable_' and '_sslmode_' are required fields.

*Example:*

....
[...]
credentials:
  username: postgres
  database": postgres
  ssl:
  enable: true
  sslmode: require
  sslcert: ./certs/client/client.crt
  sslkey: ./certs/client/client.key
  sslrootca: ./certs/client/ca.crt
  sslervercert: ./certs/server/server.crt
  sslserverkey: ./certs/server/server.key
  sslserverca: ./certs/server/ca.crt
[...]
....

== Example Usage

*Connecting with _psql_:*

....
$> psql "host=proxy.crunchy.lab port=5432 dbname=postgres user=postgres
sslmode=verify-ca sslcert=./certs/client/client.crt
sslkey=./certs/client/client.key sslrootcert=./certs/client/ca.crt"
....
